supply-chain-perishables
========================

A research project in the field of optimization. The original motivating application is the WFP's supply chain for perishable nutritional supplements. A two-stage stochastic program is formulated for a fixed-charge network problem. The first-stage problem contains binary decisions on nodes and is separated from the second-stage problems via a Benders Decomposition. The second-stage problems are path routing problems for which good paths are generated via a cutting-planes procedure that uses a resource-constrained shortest path subroutine.
